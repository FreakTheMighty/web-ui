Dart Web Components
===================

Dart Web Components let you build web apps as if you had a browser from the
future. You can use the cool new web technologies like [Web Components][wc],
[Model Driven Views][mdv] and [Dart](d) today. Build apps easily using HTML as
your template language, express your application's components in HTML, and
synchronize your data automatically between Dart and your components.

We believe that:

- Web Components are on their way, we should start using them now.
- Cool new features should be made available to [modern browsers](mb) that
  haven't yet implemented them.
- Write/Reload is just as important as write/compile/minimize/ship.
- Working in open source is the way to go.
- Developers from all backgrounds should be building awesome modern web apps.

This library is under construction. More coming soon!

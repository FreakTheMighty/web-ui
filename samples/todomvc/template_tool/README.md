This directory contains the Todo MVC application that works with the template
compiler.

Today the code for the Todo application has slight differences with the polyfill
version of the Todo application.  This of course needs to be fixed - ASAP.
Here is quick lists of issues to be resolved:

  - root.query("#elem-id") is autogenerated by the template (there is some web
    components that have hard coded implementation to do that manually.
  - two-way binding is only exposed for HTML elements where two-way binding
    makes sense (INPUT checkbox tag for checked attribute, INPUT edit tag for
    value attribute,  and automatic 1-way bindig for the Anchor tag xref
    attribute).
  - Web component implementation is body of the class for the template compiler.
    Polyfill assumes the webcomponent code defines the class; this implies that
    the template compiler would need to inject code within the user's class
    (need to parse the Dart class).
  - The todo class at the todomvc top level needs to be used instead of the
    todo in todomvc/output.

Generating the code:

    bin/dwc.dart --verbose samples/todomvc/template_tool/main.html

this will generated a number of files with the *.html.dart and *.html.html

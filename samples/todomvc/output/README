TodoMVC sample application written with web-components and manually bound
models. This example illustrates what the executable code would look like for
an application written using Dart-adapted MDV-style templates. It can also be
used as a guideline for how our tools will generate code from the template
input.

See the sibling 'input' directory to visualize what users would write to get the
code (manually) generated here.

To run this code, load it on Dartium, but executing Dartium with the following
flags:
  --enable-shadow-dom
  --enable-scoped-style
  --allow-file-access-from-files
  --enable-devtools-experiments

TodoMVC sample application written with web-components and templates bound to
models. The `output` directory illustrates what the executable code would look
like for an application written using Dart-adapted MDV-style templates. It can
also be used as a guideline for how our tools will generate code from the
template input. The current code in `output` was generated by hand.

See the `input` directory to visualize what you would write to produce the code
generated in `output`.

The version in `polyfill` runs out of the box on Dartium using dart:mirrors.
That means you can edit it and refresh and see it automatically update.

To run this code, launch [Dartium][] with `--enable-shadow-dom`
`--enable-scoped-style` `--allow-file-access-from-files`
`--enable-devtools-experiments` and then open either `output/main.html` or
`polyfill/main.html`

Please note that this sample is intended to work on all [modern browsers][m] but
at the moment we rely on features like scoped styles and shadow DOM that have
only been implemented in Chrome. The `output` verion will run in Chrome using
the [dart2js][] compiler. Firefox support is blocked on a
[bug in matchesSelector](http://dartbug.com/4401). Support for other browsers is
blocked on support for
[DOM mutation observers](http://www.w3.org/TR/dom/#mutation-observers).

TodoMVC sample application written with web-components and templates bound to
models. The `output` directory illustrates what the executable code would look
like for an application written using Dart-adapted MDV-style templates. It can
also be used as a guideline for how our tools will generate code from the
template input. The current code in `output` was generated by hand.

See the `input` directory to visualize what you would write to produce the code
generated in `output`.

To run this code, launch [Dartium][] with the following flags:

    --enable-shadow-dom --enable-scoped-style --allow-file-access-from-files --enable-devtools-experiments

and then open `output/main.html`

Please note that this sample is intended to work on all [modern browsers][m] but
at the moment we rely on features like scoped styles and shadow DOM that have
only been implemented in Chrome. It will also run in normal Chrome using the
[dart2js][] compiler. Firefox support is blocked on a
[bug in matchesSelector](http://dartbug.com/4401).
